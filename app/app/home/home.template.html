            <p>My name is Jim Crawford, and I am a software developer/architect currently residing in Nashville, TN. Programming has fascinated me since I was a child. My parents like to remind me about how they had to pull me away from our old Commodore 64 for fear of me losing my eyesight. Later when we acquired an Apple IIc, I worked on writing a port of the DOS shell, just because my 8 year old self thought it was neat. From what I recall, it was probably a mess of code even with the help of the almighty GOSUB.</p>

            <p>I've mostly cut my teeth doing various projects in and around the healthcare industry. As such, my portfolio is quite heavy in the Microsoft stack. I have worked to highlight various projects that demonstrate some breadth of knowledge, as well as highlighting various points of my career.</p>
