    Here's the problem: I just put together a site using AngularJS, just to see if I could do it, and 
    learn yet another JavaScript library in a day or two. You are probably in the same boat, 
    only it only took you half a day to get to this point (I'm slow, bear with me). Once you get
    done, you deploy your nice new site, and notice that the hash routing is in place.

<p>
    This is fine, except when you want to hand someone a nice link to the inside of your site. Sometimes it works,
    sometimes (if you have SSO redirects, or other redirects), the content of the url after the hash
    is unceremoniously dumped out, since it wasn't important.
</p>

<p>
    Lucky for us that use modern browsers, AngularJS has a solution. The html5Mode setting within
    the locationProvider class will allow browsers that can utilize the new setState in browser
    history to use hashless urls, which gracefully degrading to the hashtags of those that cannot
    support this functionality.
</p>

<p>
    Getting this up and running within your application is actually, pretty simple. We simply change any relative or absolute urls
    that are in markup to not have the hashtag, for instance <code>/portfolio</code> instead of <code>/#/portfolio</code>.
    Then we can modify the app.config.js file to include the following when configuring routes:
    
<pre>
    <span class="purple">app</span>
        .config([<span class="orange">'$locationProvider'</span>, <span class='orange'>'$routeProvider'</span>,
            <span class="blue">function</span> config($locationProvider, $routeProvider) {
                $locationProvider.html5Mode(<span class="blue">true</span>);
                <span class="green">/* Add routing and other configuration here. */</span>
            }
        ]);
</pre>

<p>
    Easy enough. Once we push this out, and look, then we have it, no hash tags:
</p>

<p>
    Here's the fun part. When you type in a url, say <code>http://mycodinglife.com/portfolio</code> to simulate a click on an external link,
    you get a <code>404</code>. The reason for this is that the angular router isn't instantiated, since you do not go through <code>index.html</code>
    first. There are many examples on what to do here, each slightly different. My particular site is run on an Apache server to which I do not have
    access to do any configuration. However, we can append a special rewrite rule to the <code>.htaccess</code> file. There are other techniques for
    doing this in IIS, if needed.
</p>

<p>
    What worked for me was adding the following into the <code>.htaccess</code> file in the root of the site:
</p>

<pre>
    <span class="purple">Options</span> +FollowSymLinks
    <span class="purple">RewriteEngine</span> On
    <span class="purple">RewriteCond</span> %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    <span class="purple">RewriteCond</span> %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    <span class="purple">RewriteRule</span> ^(.*)$ /index.html [QSA,L]
</pre>

<p>
    In essence, this tells Apache that any url that does not match an existing physical or symbolic file or directory will
    get rewritten to call directly to <code>index.html</code>, which then runs the url through the Angular router, allowing urls
    to be accessed directly within the site as if it were all physical pages.
</p>

    Hope this helps!
